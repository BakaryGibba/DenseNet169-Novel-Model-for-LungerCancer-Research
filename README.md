Thanks, Bakary. Based on your instruction to **only focus on the DenseNet169 novel model**, here's a clean, professional documentation (README-style) tailored to that architecture and your research context:

# 🧠 DenseNet169-Based Novel Deep Learning Model for Lung Cancer Detection

### A Custom Architecture Integrating SE Block and Multi-Scale Feature Fusion

---

## 📘 Overview

This repository contains a **novel deep learning model** built upon the **DenseNet169** architecture, tailored specifically for **lung cancer detection** using medical imaging. The model integrates two critical enhancements: **Squeeze-and-Excitation (SE) blocks** and a **Feature Pyramid Network (FPN)-like fusion module** to improve feature discrimination and robustness across lesion scales.

## 🧪 Research Background

**Title**: *Enhancing Lung Cancer Detection with DenseNet169 and SVM: A Hybrid Deep Learning Framework with Explainable AI*

This research aims to enhance the diagnostic process of lung cancer by developing a highly accurate model with an improved DenseNet backbone. The proposed architecture addresses challenges such as:

* **Class imbalance in medical datasets**
* **Subtle lesion variations**
* **Interpretability of deep features**

---

## 🏗️ Model Contributions

### ✅ 1. **DenseNet169 Backbone**

Used as the feature extractor without top layers (`include_top=False`) and preloaded with custom-trained weights.

```python
base_model = DenseNet169(include_top=False, input_shape=(224, 224, 3), weights=None)
base_model.load_weights(densenet169_weights_path)
```

---

### ✅ 2. **Squeeze-and-Excitation (SE) Block**

A channel-wise attention mechanism introduced after the DenseNet feature extractor. It improves the model’s ability to focus on more informative channels by adaptively recalibrating them.

```python
def se_block(input_tensor, ratio=16):
    ...
    return Multiply()([input_tensor, se])
```

> 📌 **Purpose**: Enhance important features, suppress noise, and guide better classification decisions.

---

### ✅ 3. **Feature Pyramid Network (FPN)-like Fusion**

Multi-scale feature maps from intermediate DenseNet layers are fused using a simplified FPN structure. This helps the model learn both low-level and high-level spatial features, which is particularly effective in capturing lesions of varying sizes.

```python
def fpn_block(pyramid_features):
    ...
    return fused_features
```

> 📌 **Layers Used**:

* `conv2_block6_concat` (Dense Block 1)
* `conv3_block12_concat` (Dense Block 2)
* `conv4_block24_concat` (Dense Block 3)
* `conv5_block16_concat` (Dense Block 4)

These layers are fused hierarchically to form a richer final feature representation.

---

### ✅ 4. **Custom Focal Loss for Imbalanced Data**

To counter class imbalance, a class-weighted **focal loss function** is applied during training.

```python
def focal_loss(gamma=2., alpha=[10, 1, 2]):
    ...
```
